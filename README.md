# stockz-site
Static stock web site that deals with the management of inventory
This web site is called Educational Stock Exchange and was made essentially by Team Awesome and edited by us. 
It is composed of four files; index (=home), stockgraph, about and contact (which was added by us). 
The application allows the user to "invest" in our integrated stock system, using a credit system and a full reset option.  
This allows users to learn how to invest in a stock without the risk of serious financial losses.
